# Personal Chart Markups

These are my personal chart markups and trading commentary.

⚠️ Note: I use terminology and concepts from Al Brooks’s *Price Action* trading approach (e.g., "High 1", "Low 2", "Always In", etc).  
For definitions of these terms, see the [Brooks Trading Course glossary](https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/price-action-trading-terms-glossary/).
